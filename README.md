#### By _**Michael G Connelly**_

#### simple quiz to help the user decide what programming language to learn

## Technologies Used

* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript

## Description

This was created as my second independent project for Epicodus. The goal was to create an application for people interested in coding to decide which language they should learn first. Here are the main objectives:
* Include a form with a minimum of 5 survey questions.
* Offer a minimum of 3 different language suggestions.
* One branch should return one result. It shouldn't be possible to be suggested two languages at once.
* Make sure that when the user submits the survey again (for a second or third time), that previous answers are hidden, cleared, or replaced prior to showing the new result.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Just run in your browser.
